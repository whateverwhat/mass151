In this work, we study the problem of building a practical system which provides realtime and accurate indoor localization service for smart phone users. While many innovative proposals have been presented in the literature, we take advantage of the SURF vision feature and perspective projection model to build reference point database and to perform indoor localization without deploying any infrastructure. Our approach is simple but works effectively to provide localization service in indoor environment with reasonable accuracy. We further improve the accuracy using enhanced estimate check function $Func2$. Through all processes of \oursystem, there is not much expenditure in time and cost for site-survey or running the system. We are convinced that our proposal can suggest a new approach combining computer vision technique with indoor localization research.
